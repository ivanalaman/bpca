dt.tools             Calculates vector variable lengths, angles between vector
                     variables and variable correlations from `data.frame' or
                     `matrix' objects.
plot.bpca.2d         Plots `bpca.2d' objects with the package `graphics'.

print.xtable         Creates generic print.xtable
print.xtable.bpca    Prints `xtable.bpca' objects.
print.xtable.default Prints `xtable' objects.
qbpca                Evaluates the quality of the biplot representation for
                     `bpca.2d' and `bpca.3d' objects.
summary.bpca         Summarizes `bpca' (`bpca.2d' and `bpca.3d') objects.
var.rbf              Calculates the matrix of graphical correlations projected by
                     the biplot for `bpca.2d' and `bpca.3d' objects.
var.rdf              Calculates the matrix of `poor' graphical correlations,
                     represented by the biplot, for `bpca.2d' and `bpca_3d'
                     objects.
xtable.bpca          Creates xtable method to bpca objects.
